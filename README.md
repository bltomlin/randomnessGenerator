# randomnessGenerator
Everyone knows that people are bad at generating random things. This script will check this assumption using a small self-written program that will predict "random" user actions. We'll see if you can beat it!

## Installation

```
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/bltomlin/randomnessGenerator

# change the working directory to randomnessGenerator
$ cd randomnessGenerator

# run from CLI
$ python rgen.py
```

## Examples

For simplicity, we will limit ourselves to a string of length 20 in this example.

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

```
> 01000111001
Current data length is 11, 9 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 2345
Current data length is 11, 9 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 1010456
Current data length is 15, 5 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 0100010

Final data string:
0100011100110100100010
```
